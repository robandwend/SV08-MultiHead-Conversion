# SOVOL SV08 Multihead Conversion

### THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - CHANGES WILL BE MADE

I'm currently converting my SV08 to a multi-toolhead printer. I'm keeping the costs way down by using the standard SV08 toolheads.

This repo contains the files designs I've used for mounting on the SV08.

For full build overview on a SV08, I suggest watching Teaching Tech's series on doing the conversion. At this time he's not yet finished, and hasn't published any of the cad work - hence me re-inventing the wheel in this design. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6kc_BnYU8w&t=2s

For an initial intro here's a quick video I did to show the mount. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clDU7j5NY64

The top 2020 extrusion has pre-built supports. Due to it's lenght and the small bolt holes, please ensure you compensate for any shrinkage when printing - size accuracy is key.

The bottom 2020 support pieces also have a hole printing guide. You can either drill and tap, or drill and place a small nut behind the hole to attach.

The head cover has built in supports for the clips, but may need manual supports on the front left/right indent area (depending on how well your bridging works.

Magnets - I've replaced the standard 4x3 magnets with 4x6 (or two 4x3) to increase pull strength.

The head mount is based on using the stealthchanges Front https://github.com/DraftShift/StealthChanger Specifically
